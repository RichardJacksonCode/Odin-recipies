            <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>
                   Hello to anyone who is reading this and also hello to future me that is going to 
                   create this recipe website using HTML, CSS, and unfortunately, JavaScript. Yes, the 
                   language that feel like doing a Sisyphean task by only trying to use it.
                </p>
                <p>But to the point of this website. This is a project created to demostrate
                    my ability with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and in this case is about a website that 
                    will teach the client how to cook with the simple things they have at home and by someone
                    who doesn't have any idea how to cook. Why? Because the ultimate purpose is to learn, become
                    the almighty student, and enjoy the ride while we learn something new. Besides, I want to
                    know how far can I go by cooking things without having any idea on what I am doing.
                    It will be fun.
                </p>

            <p>Note: All the images are free to use(base on duckduckgo) and doesn't
                represent the reality of the website, however, I am going to have
                better pictures in the future. Remember, this is a long project and this
                is version 1.0 :)
